# piano-midi-autoplayer
translates .mid (midi) files to keystrokes, designed to work with ROBLOX pianos. Includes random "humanization" effects to imitate the human behind the instrument.

main.py will play the notes with duration, which will hold notes.
noDuration.py, as you can tell from the name, will only press the note for a very short time.

you might need to install a few python libraries though.
