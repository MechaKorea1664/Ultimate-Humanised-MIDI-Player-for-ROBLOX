# piano-midi-autoplayer
translates .mid (midi) files to keystrokes, designed to work with ROBLOX pianos. Includes random "humanization" effects to imitate the human behind the instrument.

main.py will play the notes with duration, which will hold notes.
noDuration.py, as you can tell from the name, will only press the note for a very short time.

**How to run the program:** You need to run this in a command prompt. After you navigate to where the .py files are, whichever you chose to run, type for example:

"python main.py --help" (of course, you may replace main.py with noDuration.py, or any in the backup if desired)

this will show you all the available flags and formatting.

you might need to install a few python libraries though.
